Here is a list of some common and useful sql commands, since i'm messing around with this today.

I always keep looking these up, so this new blog is a good place to catalog them.

Login to MySQL:

{% highlight ruby %}
mysql -u root -p
{% endhighlight %}

You'll be prompted for your password.  Enter it.

Next, view the existing databases.

{% highlight ruby %}
SHOW DATABASES;
{% endhighlight %}

A list of all of the existing databases will appear.

Create a Database:

{% highlight ruby %}
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
{% endhighlight %}

testdb is the name of the database.  Now, to view the database.

Use the database:

{% highlight ruby %}
USE testdb;
{% endhighlight %}

Grant all permissions to a specific user:

{% highlight ruby %}
GRANT ALL ON testdb.* TO 'your_mysql_name'@'your_client_host';
{% endhighlight %}
