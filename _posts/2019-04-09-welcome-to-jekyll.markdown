Here is a list of some common and useful sql commands, since i'm messing around with this today.

Login to MySQL:

{% highlight ruby %}
mysql -u root -p
{% endhighlight %}


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
